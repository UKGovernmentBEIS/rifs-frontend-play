## GOVUK resources

This application should be designed to pass a GDS service assessment

do not carry the Crown logo.

## User experience

The UX language is efficient and simple.  This is the result of much thought and synthesis from the UX team, and 
considerable research with the users.  

The UX team have provided high fidelity mock-ups of the screens and interactions.  [View the protoype](FIXME.axshare.com)
